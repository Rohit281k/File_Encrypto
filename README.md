# File_Encrypto
Encrypt and Decrypt files (AES) in Python.

One can use this to encrypt text,images and mp3 files and it's helpful to encrypt stored passwords or anything which you want to keep secret. Just remember the password!!!

# Getting Started
Installation:-

1. Python 3.x

2. pycrypto

3. Copy the files inside the modules folder as it is and paste it in the Lib folder of your python directory. Pycrypto works better in 2.x version and for 3.x version you have to make some necessary changes. Note:- Don't worry I've done that just copy the files and it should work for you.
